%\section{Computing Mersenne Primes In The Modern Era}
%The creation of modern computers has permitted us to explore larger and larger Mersenne Numbers.  Today we find the largest known primes through the use of Mersenne Numbers and the Lucas-Lehmer test.

\section{Finding Mersenne Primes}
The advent of the modern computer has allowed us to find larger and larger Mersenne Primes.  The process is fairly straightforward from a high level, but the implementation details are of great importance and interest. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has been the most successful project in this regard and we will examine their algorithms as an example.
