    <h1>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h1>
	<!-- To find large primes we must first generate small primes to use as p in 2^p - 1 -->
    <!-- It hurts to use a table here, but I can't get the floats quite right -->
    <h1>Interactive Lucas-Lehmer Test</h1>
	<!-- This JavaScript implementation of LLT illustrates the difficulty of searching for Mersenne Primes. -->

    <h1>Mersenne Numbers are Repunits!</h1>
	<!-- Repunits are any numbers made up of repeated 1's -->
	<!-- In binary notation powers of 2 are a single 1 followed by 0's -->
	<!-- Therefore powers of 2 minus 1 are all 1's, and Mersenne numbers are repunits in binary -->
